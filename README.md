# KeyboardShooter

2D defense game where the player must type words above heads of approaching red squares
to defend their base. The speed increases as play continues.

I originally created this after playing through the entirety of "Typing of the Dead" with 
my friend Demetrius over a weekend. I enjoyed the game so much that I wanted to recreate 
the same feeling of rising pressure as an enemy closes in on you while you're fumbling away
at a keyboard. I think I did an alright job. 

I have no comments for what I'd change about the programming in this app. I think it works
as well as it needs to. I particularly like the dictionary system, and how it's easy to expand.
Players can add difficulty by adding words out of the domain they commonly use. Perhaps, this
could be made into some kind of education tool by linking two dictionaries by phrase meaning
in different natural languages. And of course, sounds and effects should be added.

# Adding new words
Adding new words is fairly straightforward. To add a custom dictionary, create a text file
in the resources folder. Every non-blank line is considered a word. For extra challenge,
try adding uncommon characters.
